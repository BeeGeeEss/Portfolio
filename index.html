            <p>Hi! My name is Bee...
              <br>
              <br>
              Welcome to the home and headquarters of Bee Gee Ess Designs.<br>I live in regional Victoria along the beautiful Murray River and I work part-time in the office and part-time at home as a Digital Project Manager.<br>I have a background in Early Childhood Education, Social Work, Counselling and Psychology - at the end of last year I took a leap and started a secondment in the Digital Services team at my organisation. This year I stayed onboard as a full-time staff member. I have always wanted to learn how to code, and how to build websites. This was the perfect time to start retraining in another field while I have the ability to practice hands on skills, in my day-to-day work.
              <br>
              <br>
              I like understanding how systems work & observing human dynamics.<br> I enjoy gym, yoga, and eating pickles.
              <br>
              <br>
              My goal in life is to be so skilled at working in multiple fields that I can work from anywhere in the world and work in a different field each day. I'm currently upskilling in counselling with the hope that I will be able to own my own business within the next five years, and it would be great to do the same with coding. I have been thinking about pursuing cloud architecture... but that would be a long way in the future...
              <br>
              <br>
              Did I mention that I still want to train as a Clinical Psychologist?... and complete a cabinet-making apprenticeship?... but there's plenty of time...</p>
